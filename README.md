# Raindrop Reimagined – Knowledge Asset Platform

A retrieval-first redesign of Raindrop.io that helps users not just save links, but actually find and reuse what they’ve discovered.

## What the Product Does

This version turns Raindrop from a simple bookmark manager into a **Knowledge Asset Platform**.  
Users can save links, notes, videos, and articles, and quickly retrieve them using smart search and recommendations.

## Why It Matters

People save a lot of content and never find it again.  
Traditional bookmark tools focus on storage. Users need **retrieval**: “What did I save about X and where is it?”

## Who It’s For

- Students and lifelong learners  
- Researchers and writers  
- Knowledge workers who collect links, docs, and ideas  
- Anyone drowning in screenshots, open tabs, and saved posts

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-first onboarding:** New users save a few items and immediately see how search works.
- **“Ask My Archives”:** Natural language search. e.g. “Show me all AI tools I saved last month.”
- **Rediscover Dashboard:** Surfaces old but relevant saves based on current activity.
- **Smarter connections:** See related saves grouped by topic, not just folders.
- **Multi-device access:** Works on web and mobile.

## Planned Technologies

- Frontend: React (Web), responsive UI
- Backend: Node.js / Express
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Search & AI: Elasticsearch or vector search + an LLM API for “Ask My Archives”
